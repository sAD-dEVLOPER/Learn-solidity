<h1> What it is?</h1>
<h2> 
    A smart contract is a simple program stored on the blockchain and executed when certain conditions are met. They are typically used to automate the execution of contracts, so that all parties can see the results immediately, without intermediaries or wasted time. You can also automate workflows and trigger the next action when conditions are met.
</h2>

<h1> How smart contracts work</h1>

<h2> Smart contracts work by following simple "if/when...then..." statements written in code on the blockchain. A network of computers performs an action when certain conditions are met and verified. These actions may include releasing funds to appropriate parties, registering vehicles, sending notifications, or issuing tickets. The blockchain is updated once the transaction is completed. This means that the transaction cannot be changed and only authorized parties can see the results.

    Within a smart contract, you can include as many conditions as you need to convince participants that the task will be completed satisfactorily. To set conditions, participants decide how transactions and their data are represented on the blockchain, and apply the “if/when...then...” rules that govern those transactions. Framework for defining dispute resolution, agreeing and examining possible exceptions.
    
    After that, developers can program smart contracts, but more and more organizations that use blockchain for their business provide templates, web interfaces, and other online tools to simplify the structure of smart contracts. </h2>

<div class="box-container">
    <div class="box">
        <h3>Speed, efficiency and accuracy</h3>
        <p>Once the conditions are met, the contract will be executed immediately. Because smart contracts are digitized and automated, there is no paperwork to do and no time spent reconciling the errors that often occur with manually filling out documents. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
       
        <h3>Trust and transparency</h3>
        <p> No third parties are involved and encrypted transaction records are shared between participants, so there is no need to doubt whether information has been altered for personal gain. </p>
            </div>
    <div class="box">
        
        <h3> Security</h3>
        <p>
            Blockchain transaction records are encrypted, making them extremely difficult to hack. Additionally, each record is linked to the previous and next record on the distributed ledger, requiring a hacker to change the entire chain to change a single record.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
 
        <h3>Savings</h3>
        <p>Smart contracts remove the need for intermediaries to handle transactions and, by extension, their associated time delays and fees. </p>
